* server-side caching?
* improve client-side caching
* support for diffs
* support for viewing commit details, author details
* JavaScript XHR preview

* online conflict resolution
The user should be presented with two text areas (his just-submitted version,
and the current tip of the branch) to allow interactive merges.

* show unmerged conflicts on the page itself

* proper support for merge commits in history?
The current approach simply sorts commits by time to achieve a somewhat
sensible linear history. Using toposort would be a start.

* non-breaking space in link texts?

* commit IDs in links
  - Images in past versions should probably appear as they were back then.
  - Should the tree view spare out the commit ID if HEAD is viewed? I think
    so. Compare how the rest of the code handles this and create consistent behaviour.

* sort directories first in tree view?
