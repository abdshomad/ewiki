* conflict resolution
Allow the user to resolve conflicts when a fast-forward merge of an edited
page fails. The code should first check whether the file being edited has
actually been modified in the meantime, and if so, present the user with two
text areas (his just-submitted version, and the current tip of the branch) to
allow interactive merges.

Ideally, for each conflict, a topic branch is created to ensure no work is
lost. Maybe there could also be a "pending merges" page.

* authentication

== less important
* server-side caching?
* client-side caching?
* support for diffs
* revamped markup
* support for inline images?
* support for viewing commit details, author details

* proper support for merge commits in history?
The current approach simply sorts commits by time to achieve a somewhat
sensible linear history.
